# AirDrop-AppleScript
A script to select AirDrop from Finder's Share menu. Assign to a keyboard shortcut for quick AirDropping

There are a couple ways to use it. You can put the script in an Automator workflow as a Service/Quick Action and set a keyboard shortcut for that Service in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, or use a utility like [FastScripts](https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) to set a shortcut for just the script itself.

Tested on macOS 10.14 Mojave, 10.15 Catalina, and 11 Big Sur.
